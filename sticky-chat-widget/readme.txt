<strong>Searching for the best chat plugin for WordPress?</strong> Your search ends here with Sticky Chat Widget. This powerful plugin supports 20+ platforms including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Viber, Line, Email, Telegram, VKontakte, SMS, WeChat, Skype, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Waze, and even custom links. With support for almost every popular app, your customers can contact you directly using the channels they already have installed. Sticky Chat Widget is available in both Free and Pro versions.

= Why Choose Sticky Chat Widget? =

* <strong>More Flexible than Live Chat:</strong> Unlike traditional live chat, which locks users into one channel and requires them to stay on your site, Sticky Chat Widget lets visitors connect via the apps they already use daily — Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and more. They can message you anytime, even after leaving your website.

* <strong>One-Click Chat:</strong> Give your users the freedom to choose how they reach you. Add only the chat platforms where you’re active, so you can stay available without overwhelming your visitors. With a single click, they can start a conversation instantly.

* <strong>Share Your Location:</strong> Running a physical store? Platforms like Waze make it easy to share your location, guide customers directly to your shop, and convert visits into sales.

* <strong>Business Hours Control (Pro):</strong> Set specific days and times when chat icons are displayed on your site. Perfect for businesses that want to show availability only during working hours — included in the Pro version.
